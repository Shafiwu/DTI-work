 <p>
    <b> Salaga Slave Market </b> is an 18th-century slave market located in the East Gonja District of the Savannah Region of Ghana. <br> During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, Salaga served as an important market where slaves were transported to the coast for export. The market also served as outposts for the movement of slaves along the trans-Saharan routes. <br>
 </p>
 <p>
     From the 16th century, Salaga was one of leading market centers in West Africa. Salaga was founded by the Mande leader Dyakpa Nde wura in <br>16th century Gonja kingdom before being overrun by Asante forces in 1744. During the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1874, the British defeat of <br> the Asante ended the Asante rule over Salaga. However, this coupled with the British abolition of slavery in the Gold Coast in 1874 - 1875 did <br> not end the Salaga Slave market practices in the Gold Coast. There were frequent caravans of slaves from Salaga to Kintampo slave market, then to southern or coastal areas, however it was abolished in 1896. Kete-Krachi took over, <br> then slave caravans, some of which were ordered by the slave raider Babatu came there directly from Bole, Wa, Bonotuku and Upper Volta. 
 </p>
 <p>
     Kola, beads, ostrich feathers, animal hides, textiles and gold were among the goods traded in the market. However, in the 18th century, the <br>market became a key center in the trading of humans. People from the Upper west, Upper East and Northern Regions served as sources for slaves.<br> Slaves from the market were mostly exchanged for Kola nuts, cowries and gold. 
 </p>
 <p>
     At the market, there were various stands for slaves, cattle, sheep, and merchandise. Slaves would be inspected and bargained for a price. A variety <br>of people benefited from slavery at the market as it became a commercial venture. For example, local chiefs benefited through the sale of slaves.<br>Although there was a sentiment that the practice was inhumane, it became a common feature of life in Salaga.
 </p>
 <h2 style="padding: 10px;"><span style="color: #38d760;">Features</span> Of Salaga</h2>
 <p>
     Slaves were kept in a warehouse with a mud roof during rainy days. In modern times, the roof is protected by an aluminium roof to protect from <br>unexpected weather changes. Wells located around the market are, according to oral tradition, associated with slave labour although the water <br>management system pre-dated the slave trade. There is also a stream that is often associated with the well said to have been the bathing place of <br>slaves, known as wanka bayu. Additionally, there were was a slave cemetery known as rafia angulu.
 </p>

 <p>
     In modern times, the Salaga Slave market was abandoned by the East Gonja District Assembly and the Ghana Tourism Authority. It had been <br>reduced to a parking space or used mainly for business activities. However, recently through initiatives such as the 2024 Emancipation Day <br>celebration, the Ghana Tourism Authority has decided to refurbish the slave market and the slave wells. This was a restorative effort to transform<br> the past of the market into a "beacon of remembrance and healing."
 </p>
 <p>
     The effort is to transform the market and the wells into a top class cultural and tourist destination. Doing so would serve as a learning experience <br>to build a more inclusive and equitable society. As stated by the Minister of Tourism, Arts, and Culture, the refurbishment of the Salage Slave <br>market and Wells seeks to "drum home the sacrifices made by ancestors during their enslavement and their unwavering struggle for freedom." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaga_Slave_Market">Reference</a>

 <h1 style="text-align: center;padding: 10px;">Below images is about me <span style="color: #38d760;"> having a wonderful experiences </span> in salaga museum  </h1>
 <p>During my visit to the Salaga Slave Market, I had a profound and enlightening experience. The on-site museum provided a comprehensive <br>understanding of the market's history, offering a poignant glimpse into the transatlantic slave trade.<p>

     <p>The museum's walls feature an impressive collection of paintings that vividly depict the realities of slavery. These artworks illustrate the diverse <br>groups of people who were enslaved, their oppressors, and the tools used to subjugate them. Notably, the exhibits also highlight the exceptional<br> talents and skills of enslaved individuals.<p>
     
     <p>A knowledgeable director is available to guide visitors through the museum, providing a detailed and engaging interpretation of the artworks.<br>Through their narratives, the director brings the history to life, making the experience feel eerily contemporary.<p>
     
     <p>Overall, my visit to the Salaga Slave Market and museum was a moving and educational experience, offering valuable insights into a painful yet <br>significant chapter in human history. <p>
