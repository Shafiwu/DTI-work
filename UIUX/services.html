        <p>
            A custom e-commerce website is a fully tailored online store designed and built to meet the specific needs and goals of a business. Unlike using ready-made templates or platforms (like Shopify or WooCommerce), a custom e-commerce website is created from scratch or with specialized solutions, allowing for complete flexibility in terms of design, features, and functionality

            <h2 style="color: rgb(177,213,69);;">Secure Payment Gateways</h2>
            <p>
                A secure payment gateway is a service that facilitates online payments by ensuring that payment transactions are safe, encrypted, and reliable. For a custom e-commerce website, integrating a secure payment gateway allows customers to make purchases with various payment methods (credit/debit cards, e-wallets, etc.) while protecting sensitive information, such as credit card details, from fraud. Payment gateways often include fraud protection features, encryption, and compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).

            <p>
                This refers to the process of tracking and managing the stock of products available for sale on the e-commerce platform. A custom e-commerce website will often integrate a system to keep track of product availability, low stock alerts, and automatically update stock levels when orders are placed. This ensures that the website reflects real-time product availability.

            <h2 style="color: rgb(177,213,69);;">Integration with shipping services</h2>
            <p>
                Integration with shipping services involves linking the e-commerce platform with third-party logistics or courier companies (e.g., UPS, FedEx, DHL). This allows:
Automatic calculation of shipping costs based on customer location and chosen shipping method.
Real-time tracking of shipments and delivery statuses.
Creation of shipping labels and the seamless flow of order information to the shipping service provider.
This integration can make the order fulfillment process more efficient and improve the customer experience by providing transparent shipping updates.
